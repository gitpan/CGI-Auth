CGI/Auth version 2.40
=====================

CGI::Auth provides password authentication for web-based applications.  
It uses server-based session files which are referred to by a parameter 
in all links and forms inside the scripts guarded by CGI::Auth.

Auth.pm is written in pure Perl, so it should be portable across 
operating systems.  It was originally designed on Windows NT, and has 
also been used extensively (and successfully) on Linux.

Upon installation, the documentation can be viewed by issuing the 
command 'perldoc CGI::Auth'.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Also, take a look in the extra directory for sample files to help you
get started.

DEPENDENCIES

CGI.pm version 2.0.  

    It will probably work with any version, since I don't use a lot of 
    CGI.pm's functionality, but I developed it with 2.7 and didn't want 
    to go too far back.  It's probably best to use the latest version 
    of CGI.pm anyway.
